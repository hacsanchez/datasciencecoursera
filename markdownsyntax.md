Syntax guide for markdown files

The following is a short part of the site
https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

# Structured documents

Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

You can use  one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

# This is a first-tier heading, uses the '#' tag <h1>
## This is a second-tier heading, uses the '##' tag <h2>
###### This is a Headline in h6 tag <h6>

# Emphasis
*This text will be italic*, text between '*'

_This will also be italic_ , text between '_'

**This text will be bold** , text between '**"

__This will also be bold__ , text between '__'

*You **can** combine them*

# Lists
## Unordered
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
  
## Ordered
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
   * Item 3a
   * Item 3b
   

# Images
![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)
Format: ![Alt Text](url)

# Links
http://github.com - automatic! shows the whole web address

[GitHub](http://github.com), shows just a clickable link

# Blockquotes
If you'd like to quote someone, use the '>' character before the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.
> - Captain Janeway

As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.

# Inline code
I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

# Example
It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)
